The proof is in the pudding

Well.. this is simple enough.  I started using Sphinx to create this blog.  Previously I had checked out Pelican 
and Jekyll.  Both were pretty awesome.. however the lack of search and my lack of familiarity with both was getting 
in the way of me getting something out quickly.  I want to blog!  I want to use GitHub to do it!  Get out of my way!

The source for this blog is available via the.. source of this page as well as this project on GitHub.  It's 
really, honestly, quite simple to create a blog with Sphinx.

Gotchas
-------

No ``tag`` support.. yet.

No ``tag`` based syndication.  I will have to for ``sphinxcontrib.feed`` in order to add that.
